# nix-stuff
This repo contains personalized Nix tooling, NixOS modules, etc. that I've
written myself, as well as Nix expressions I've written to package software that
I didn't write.

This repo IS NOT YET intended for general use; I plan to distribute the code
here through the [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) at some point, but
it's not quite ready yet.  Feel free to install anything you want to try on your
own system, but know that you do so AT YOUR OWN RISK.

### No License?
Not yet.  I plan to make the code here open-source at some point, but I plan
to wait to decide which license to use until there's actually something worth
sharing.  Until then, please reach out if you're interested in using my code -
I'm sure it won't be a problem, and it'll help me decide how I want to license
the repo long-term.
